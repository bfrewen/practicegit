Shel Silverstein

Ickleme, Pickleme, Tickleme, too,
Went for a ride in a flying shoe
"Horray!" "What fun!" "It's time we flew!"
Said Icklme, Picklem, Tickleme, too.

Ickle was captain and pickle was crew
Tickle served tea and Mulligan stew.
"Horray!" "What fun!" "It's time we flew!"
Said Icklme, Picklem, Tickleme, too.

Pity this busy monster, manunkind,

not. Progress is a comfortable disease:
your victim (death and life safely beyond)

plays with the bigness of his littlenss
--- electrons deify one razorblade
into a mountainrange; lenses extend
unwish through curving wherewhen till unwish
returns on its unself.
		A world of made
is not a world of born --- pity poor flesh

and trees, poor stars and stones, but never this
fine specimen of hypermagical

ultraomnipotence. We doctors know

a hopeless case if --- listen: there's a hell
of a good universe next door; let's go.
