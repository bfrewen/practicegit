A. A. Milne

James, James, Morrison, Morrison, Weatherby George Duprie
Took great care of his mother, though he was only three.
James, James, Morrison, Morrison said to his mother, said he,
"you must never go down to the end of town if you don't go down with me."

Shel Silverstein

Ickleme, Pickleme, Tickleme, too,
Went for a ride in a flying shoe
"Horray!" "What fun!" "It's time we flew!"
Said Icklme, Picklem, Tickleme, too.

Ickle was captain and pickle was crew
Tickle served tea and Mulligan stew.
"Horray!" "What fun!" "It's time we flew!"
Said Icklme, Picklem, Tickleme, too.
